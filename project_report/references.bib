  abstract = {Background The Timed Up and Go test (TUG) is a commonly used screening tool to assist clinicians to identify patients at risk of falling. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine the overall predictive value of the TUG in community-dwelling older adults. Methods A literature search was performed to identify all studies that validated the TUG test. The methodological quality of the selected studies was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool, a validated tool for the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies. A TUG score of ≥13.5~seconds was used to identify individuals at higher risk of falling. All included studies were combined using a bivariate random effects model to generate pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity at ≥13.5~seconds. Heterogeneity was assessed using the variance of logit transformed sensitivity and specificity. Results Twenty-five studies were included in the systematic review and 10 studies were included in meta-analysis. The TUG test was found to be more useful at ruling in rather than ruling out falls in individuals classified as high risk ({$>$}13.5~sec), with a higher pooled specificity (0.74, 95\% CI 0.52-0.88) than sensitivity (0.31, 95\% CI 0.13-0.57). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the TUG score is not a significant predictor of falls (OR\,=\,1.01, 95\% CI 1.00-1.02, p\,=\,0.05). Conclusion The Timed Up and Go test has limited ability to predict falls in community dwelling elderly and should not be used in isolation to identify individuals at high risk of falls in this setting.},

  abstract = {Background. Low fall-related efficacy is associated with the number and severity of future falls in older adults with balance disorders. Objective. The purpose of this study was to examine whether improvements in clinical measures of balance after an intervention program were associated with changes in efficacy. Design. A prospective, nonexperimental, pretest-posttest design was used. Methods. Sixty-three people (43 men, 20 women; mean [ϮSD] ageϭ76.6Ϯ4.9 years) with a history of at least 2 falls in the previous 12 months were enrolled between 2004 and 2008 to participate in a 12-week home exercise program. Balance deficits were identified using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), and participants were evaluated monthly. Hierarchical linear regression was used to assess the relationship between measures of balance (BBS and DGI) and efficacy (Falls Efficacy Scale) before intervention. A second model examined the relationship between changes in balance and changes in efficacy after participation in the program. Results. Preintervention scores of efficacy were significantly associated with age, depression, and BBS and DGI scores. After controlling for age, depression, and strength (force-generating capacity), BBS and DGI scores together accounted for 34\% of the variance in preintervention efficacy. Significant improvements were noted in efficacy, BBS and DGI scores, and depression after intervention. When controlling for preintervention efficacy and changes in depression, the changes in DGI and BBS scores together explained 11\% of the variance in the change in fall-related efficacy; however, only DGI scores contributed uniquely. Limitations. These results are tempered by the absence of a control group to examine the role of time on changes in efficacy. Conclusions. The results suggest that increased emphasis on mobility during rehabilitation leads to improved confidence to perform activities of daily living without falling.},

  abstract = {Background: Falls are the main cause of accidental death in persons aged 65 years or older. Methods: Using MEDLINE and previous reviews, we searched for prospective studies investigating risk factors for falls among community-dwelling older people. For risk factors investigated by at least 5 studies in a comparable way, we computed pooled odds ratios (ORs) using random-effects models, with a test for heterogeneity. Results: A total of 74 studies met the inclusion criteria and 31 risk factors were considered, including sociodemographic, mobility, sensory, psychologic, and medical factors and medication use. The strongest associations were found for history of falls (OR ϭ 2.8 for all fallers; OR ϭ 3.5 for recurrent fallers), gait problems (OR ϭ 2.1; 2.2), walking aids use (OR ϭ 2.2; 3.1), vertigo (OR ϭ 1.8; 2.3), Parkinson disease (OR ϭ 2.7; 2.8), and antiepileptic drug use (OR ϭ 1.9; 2.7). For most other factors, the ORs were moderately above 1. ORs were generally higher for recurrent fallers than for all fallers. For some factors, there was substantial heterogeneity among studies. For some important factors (eg, balance and muscle weakness), we did not compute a summary estimate because the measures used in various studies were not comparable. Conclusions: This meta-analysis provides comprehensive evidencebased assessment of risk factors for falls in older people, confirming their multifactorial etiology. Some nonspecific indicators of high baseline risk were also strong predictors of the risk of falling.},

The classical binning and counting approach to plotting reliability diagrams has been hampered by a lack of stability under unavoidable, ad hoc implementation decisions. Here, we introduce the CORP approach, which generates provably statistically consistent, optimally binned, and reproducible reliability diagrams in an automated way. CORP is based on nonparametric isotonic regression and implemented via the pool-adjacent-violators (PAV) algorithm—essentially, the CORP reliability diagram shows the graph of the PAV-(re)calibrated forecast probabilities. The CORP approach allows for uncertainty quantification via either resampling techniques or asymptotic theory, furnishes a numerical measure of miscalibration, and provides a CORP-based Brier-score decomposition that generalizes to any proper scoring rule. We anticipate that judicious uses of the PAV algorithm yield improved tools for diagnostics and inference for a very wide range of statistical and machine learning methods.},

  abstract = {Background Prediction models can identify fall-prone individuals. Prediction models can be based on either data from research cohorts (cohort-based) or routinely collected data (RCD-based). We review and compare cohort-based and RCD-based studies describing the development and/or validation of fall prediction models for community-dwelling older adults. Methods Medline and Embase were searched via Ovid until January 2023. We included studies describing the development or validation of multivariable prediction models of falls in older adults (60+). Both risk of bias and reporting quality were assessed using the PROBAST and TRIPOD, respectively. Results We included and reviewed 28 relevant studies, describing 30 prediction models (23 cohort-based and 7 RCD-based), and external validation of two existing models (one cohort-based and one RCD-based). The median sample sizes for cohort-based and RCD-based studies were 1365 [interquartile range (IQR) 426–2766] versus 90~441 (IQR 56~442–128~157), and the ranges of fall rates were 5.4\% to 60.4\% versus 1.6\% to 13.1\%, respectively. Discrimination performance was comparable between cohort-based and RCD-based models, with the respective area under the receiver operating characteristic curves ranging from 0.65 to 0.88 versus 0.71 to 0.81. The median number of predictors in cohort-based final models was 6 (IQR 5–11); for RCD-based models, it was 16 (IQR 11–26). All but one cohort-based model had high bias risks, primarily due to deficiencies in statistical analysis and outcome determination. Conclusions Cohort-based models to predict falls in older adults in the community are plentiful. RCD-based models are yet in their infancy but provide comparable predictive performance with no additional data collection efforts. Future studies should focus on methodological and reporting quality.},

However, the capability of Mindstreams tests to discriminate elderly with MCI from those who are cognitively healthy has yet to be evaluated. Moreover, the comparability between these tests and traditional neuropsychological tests in detecting MCI has not been examined. Methods A 2-center study was designed to assess discriminant validity of tests in the Mindstreams Mild Impairment Battery. Participants were 30 individuals diagnosed with MCI, 29 with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 39 healthy elderly. Testing was with the Mindstreams battery and traditional neuropsychological tests. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to examine the ability of Mindstreams and traditional measures to discriminate those with MCI from cognitively healthy elderly. Between-group comparisons were made (Mann-Whitney U test) between MCI and healthy elderly and between MCI and mild AD groups. Results Mindstreams outcome parameters across multiple cognitive domains significantly discriminated among MCI and healthy elderly with considerable effect sizes (p {$<$} 0.05). Measures of memory, executive function, visual spatial skills, and verbal fluency discriminated best, and discriminability was at least comparable to that of traditional neuropsychological tests in these domains. Conclusions Mindstreams tests are effective in detecting MCI, providing a comprehensive profile of cognitive function. Further, the enhanced precision and ease of use of these computerized tests make the NeuroTrax system a valuable clinical tool in the identification of elderly at high risk for dementia.},

  abstract = {Introduction Depression rates in older people worldwide vary from 10\% to 15\% of community-dwelling older persons. There are two others problems related to depression in old age, namely the high incidence of falls and the so-called fear of falling (FOF), with a prevalence ranging from 20\% to 85\%; it was initially considered a post-fall syndrome, which later as a fall-independent event. Aims Study aims to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to bridge the existing gap in literature about the association between depressive symptomatology, FOF, use of antidepressant therapy and falls, also identifying a possible effect of the study quality on the outcome. Methods The selection of studies was carried out between May 20, 2020, and July 27, 2020 and only observational clinical trials, written in English, with participants aged more or equal to 60 years affected by diagnosis of depression or treatment for depression mentioned both as a clinical diagnosis in older patient, and as a predictor/consequence of falls were included. The systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analysis, and the protocol was recorded in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO). Results and discussion The screening process ultimately led to the inclusion of 18 articles. Many of the included studies showed that depressive symptoms caused the subsequent increase in the number of falls. Results from the meta-analysis had no highlighted association between depression and falls, in contrast to other review and meta-analysis works: our work includes a substantial number of studies, with a relatively recent publication date, including patients diagnosed with depression, clearly evaluating the association between depression and falls. Results all seem to confirm the hypothesis of an interdependent association between the presence of FOF and the risk of fall, despite the high percentage of cross-sectional studies prevents inferring on the direction of the association. Therapeutic interventions aimed at decrease rate of falls reducing depressive symptoms and FOF.},

Efforts should be directed to fall-prevention programmes. INTRODUCTION: Falls are a common mechanism of injury and a leading cause of costs of injury in the elderly. The purpose of this study was to review for the first time the evidence of the economic burden caused by falls in old age. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in the databases of PubMed, of the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews until June 2009. Studies were assessed for inclusion, classified and synthesised. Costs per inhabitant, the share of fall-related costs in total health care expenditures and in gross domestic products (GDP) were calculated. If appropriate, cost data were inflated to the year 2006 and converted to US Dollar (USD PPP). RESULTS: A total of 32 studies were included. National fall-related costs of prevalence-based studies were between 0.85\% and 1.5\% of the total health care expenditures, 0.07\% to 0.20\% of the GDP and ranged from 113 to 547 USD PPP per inhabitant. Direct costs occurred especially in higher age groups, in females, in hospitals and long-term care facilities and for fractures. Mean costs per fall victim, per fall and per fall-related hospitalisation ranged from 2,044 to 25,955; 1,059 to 10,913 and 5,654 to 42,840 USD PPP and depended on fall severity. A more detailed comparison is restricted by the limited number of studies. CONCLUSION: Falls are a relevant economic burden to society. Efforts should be directed to economic evaluations of fall-prevention programmes aiming at reducing fall-related fractures, which contribute substantially to fall-related costs.},

The study reanalyzes 3D-acceleration data of 3-day daily life activity from 39 older people who reported less than 2 falls during one year and 31 who reported two or more falls. Phase-dependent local dynamic stability was defined for initial perturbation at 0\%, 20\%, 40\%, 60\%, and 80\% of the step cycle. A partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used to compare the discriminant abilities of phase-dependent local dynamic stability with the discriminant abilities of 35 conventional gait features. The phase-dependent local dynamic stability λ at 0\% and 60\% of the step cycle discriminated well between fallers and nonfallers (AUC = 0.83) and was significantly larger (p {$<$} 0.01) for the nonfallers. Furthermore, phase-dependent λ discriminated as well between fallers and nonfallers as all other gait features combined. The present result suggests that phase-dependent measures of local dynamic stability of daily life walking might be of importance for further development in early fall risk screening tools.},

  abstract = {Background The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) is often used in clinical practice to predict falls in the older adults. However, there is no consensus in research regarding its ability to predict falls. Objective To verify whether the BBS can predict falls risk in older adults. Data source Manual and electronic searches (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Ageline, Lilacs, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and PEDro) were conducted using blocks of words (older adults, falls, BBS, study design) and their synonyms, with no language restrictions and published since 1989. Study selection criteria Prognostic studies or clinical trials were used to assess the BBS and falls history. Data extraction and data synthesis In this narrative synthesis, two independent assessors extracted data from articles and a third reviewer provided consensus, in case of disagreement. The methodological quality was assessed using the Quality In Prognosis Studies tool. Results 1047 studies were found and 8 studies were included in this review. The mean BBS score was high, regardless of the history of falls. Three studies presented cut-off scores for BBS, ranging from 45 to 51 points. Two studies reported a difference in the BBS score between fallers and non-fallers. Studies presented low to moderate risk of bias. Limitations Unfeasible to conduct a meta-analysis due the heterogeneity of included studies. Conclusion The evidence to support the use of BBS to predict falls is insufficient, and should not be used alone to determine the risk of falling in older adults.},

  abstract = {Background. This study investigated the neuropsychological, sensorimotor, speed, and balance contributions to a new test of choice stepping reaction time (CSRT) and determined whether this new test is an important predictor of falls in older people. Methods. A total of 477 retirement-village residents aged 62 to 95 years (mean Ϯ SD, 79.2 Ϯ 6.2 years) took the CSRT test, which required them to step onto one of four panels that were illuminated in a random order. The subjects also took tests that measured neuropsychological, sensorimotor, speed, and balance function. Results. Multiple regression analysis revealed that poor performance in Part B of the Trail Making Test (a neuropsychological test) and impaired quadriceps strength, simple reaction time, sway with eyes open on a compliant surface, and maximal balance range were the best predictors of increased CSRTs (multiple r2 ϭ .45). Subjects with a history of falls had significantly increased CSRTs compared with nonfallers (1322 Ϯ 331 milliseconds and 1168 Ϯ 203 milliseconds, respectively). Impaired CSRT was a significant and independent predictor of falls, as were two complementary sensory measures (visual contrast sensitivity and lower limb proprioception). Of these measures, CSRT was the most important in predicting falls. Furthermore, the inclusion of CSRT in the model excluded measures of strength, central processing speed, and balance, because these could not provide nonredundant information for the prediction of falls. Conclusions. This study identifies a new test that provides a composite measure of falls risk in older people and elucidates the relative importance of specific physiological and neuropsychological systems in the initiation of fast and appropriate step responses.},

Some studies have found that dual task walking paradigms can predict falls in older people. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to determine whether dual task walking paradigms involving a secondary cognitive task have greater ability to predict falls than single walking tasks. The meta-analytic findings indicate single and dual task tests of gait speed are equivalent in the prediction of falls in older people and sub-group analyses revealed similar findings for studies that included only cognitively impaired participants, slow walkers or used secondary mental-tracking or verbal fluency tasks.},

  abstract = {Background Recent findings suggest that executive function (EF) plays a critical role in the regulation of gait in older adults, especially under complex and challenging conditions, and that EF deficits may, therefore, contribute to fall risk. The objective of this study was to evaluate if reduced EF is a risk factor for future falls over the course of 5 years of follow-up. Secondary objectives were to assess whether single and dual task walking abilities, an alternative window into EF, were associated with fall risk. Methodology/Main Results We longitudinally followed 256 community-living older adults (age: 76.4±4.5 yrs; 61\% women) who were dementia free and had good mobility upon entrance into the study. At baseline, a computerized cognitive battery generated an index of EF, attention, a closely related construct, and other cognitive domains. Gait was assessed during single and dual task conditions. Falls data were collected prospectively using monthly calendars. Negative binomial regression quantified risk ratios (RR). After adjusting for age, gender and the number of falls in the year prior to the study, only the EF index (RR: .85; CI: .74–.98, p = .021), the attention index (RR: .84; CI: .75–.94, p = .002) and dual tasking gait variability (RR: 1.11; CI: 1.01–1.23; p = .027) were associated with future fall risk. Other cognitive function measures were not related to falls. Survival analyses indicated that subjects with the lowest EF scores were more likely to fall sooner and more likely to experience multiple falls during the 66 months of follow-up (p{$<$}0.02). Conclusions/Significance These findings demonstrate that among community-living older adults, the risk of future falls was predicted by performance on EF and attention tests conducted 5 years earlier. The present results link falls among older adults to cognition, indicating that screening EF will likely enhance fall risk assessment, and that treatment of EF may reduce fall risk.},

  abstract = {Background The four square step test (FSST) was first validated in healthy older adults to provide a measure of dynamic standing balance and mobility. The FSST has since been used in a variety of patient populations. The purpose of this systematic review is to determine the validity and reliability of the FSST in these different adult patient populations. Methods The literature search was conducted to highlight all the studies that measured validity and reliability of the FSST. Six electronic databases were searched including AMED, CINAHL, MEDLINE, PEDro, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Grey literature was also searched for any documents relevant to the review. Two independent reviewers carried out study selection and quality assessment. The methodological quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool, which is a validated tool for the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies, and the COSMIN four-point checklist, which contains standards for evaluating reliability studies on the measurement properties of health instruments. Results Fifteen studies were reviewed studying community-dwelling older adults, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, multiple sclerosis, vestibular disorders, post stroke, post unilateral transtibial amputation, knee pain and hip osteoarthritis. Three of the studies were of moderate methodological quality scoring low in risk of bias and applicability for all domains in the QUADAS-2 tool. Three studies scored “fair” on the COSMIN four-point checklist for the reliability components. The concurrent validity of the FSST was measured in nine of the studies with moderate to strong correlations being found. Excellent Intraclass Correlation Coefficients were found between physiotherapists carrying out the tests (ICC~=~.99) with good to excellent test-retest reliability shown in nine of the studies (ICC~=~.73–.98). Conclusions The FSST may be an effective and valid tool for measuring dynamic balance and a participants’ falls risk. It has been shown to have strong correlations with other measures of balance and mobility with good reliability shown in a number of populations. However, the quality of the papers reviewed was variable with key factors, such as sample size and test set up, needing to be addressed before the tool can be confidently used in these specified populations.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify all published papers on risk factors and risk assessment tools for falls in hospital inpatients. To identify clinical risk assessment tools or individual clinical risk factors predictive of falls, with the ultimate aim of informing the design of effective fall prevention strategies. DESIGN: Systematic literature review (Cochrane methodology). Independent assessment of quality against agreed criteria. Calculation of odds ratios and 95\% confidence intervals for risk factors and of sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive value for risk assessment tools (with odds ratios and confidence intervals), where published data sufficient. RESULTS: 28 papers on risk factors were identified, with 15 excluded from further analysis. Despite the identification of 47 papers purporting to describe falls risk assessment tools, only six papers were identified where risk assessment tools had been subjected to prospective validation, and only two where validation had been performed in two or more patient cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: A small number of significant falls risk factors emerged consistently, despite the heterogeneity of settings namely gait instability, agitated confusion, urinary incontinence/frequency, falls history and prescription of 'culprit' drugs (especially sedative/hypnotics). Simple risk assessment tools constructed of similar variables have been shown to predict falls with sensitivity and specificity in excess of 70\%, although validation in a variety of settings and in routine clinical use is lacking. Effective falls interventions in this population may require the use of better-validated risk assessment tools, or alternatively, attention to common reversible falls risk factors in all patients.},

  abstract = {Background. The Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) is a reliable and valid measure of gait-related activities. Objective. The purpose of this study was to determine the concurrent, discriminative, and predictive validity of the FGA in community-dwelling older adults. Design. This was a prospective cohort study. Methods. Thirty-five older adults aged 60 to 90 years completed the Activitiesspecific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), Timed “Up \& Go” Test (TUG), and Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) during one session. Falls were tracked by having participants complete a monthly fall calendar for 6 months. Spearman correlation coefficients were used to determine concurrent validity among the ABC, BBS, TUG, DGI, and FGA. To determine the optimum scores to classify fall risk, sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), and positive and negative likelihood ratios (LRϩ and LRϪ) were calculated for the FGA in classifying fall risk based on the published criterion scores of the DGI and TUG and for the FGA, TUG, and DGI in identifying prospective falls. Receiver operator curves with area under the curve were used to determine the effectiveness of the FGA in classifying fall risk and of the DGI, TUG, and FGA in identifying prospective falls. D.M.

Functional gait assessment: concurrent, discriminative, and predictive validity in communitydwelling older adults. Phys Ther. 2010;90:761–773.] © 2010 American Physical Therapy Association Results. The FGA correlated with the ABC (rϭ.053, PϽ.001), BBS (rϭ.84, PϽ.001), and TUG (rϭϪ.84, PϽ.001). An FGA score of Յ22/30 provides both discriminative and predictive validity. The FGA (scores Յ22/30) provided 100\% Sn, 72\% Sp, LRϩ of 3.6, and LRϪ of 0 to predict prospective falls. Limitations. The study was limited by the length of time of follow-up and the small sample size that did not allow for evaluation of criterion scores by decade. Conclusions. The FGA with a cutoff score of 22/30 is effective in classifying fall risk in older adults and predicting unexplained falls in community-dwelling older adults.},
