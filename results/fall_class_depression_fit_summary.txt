 Family: bernoulli 
  Links: mu = logit 
Formula: FALLER ~ 1 + z_GDS 
   Data: data (Number of observations: 76) 
  Draws: 4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1;
         total post-warmup draws = 4000

Draws were sampled using sampling(NUTS). For each parameter, Bulk_ESS
and Tail_ESS are effective sample size measures, and Rhat is the potential
scale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat = 1).
